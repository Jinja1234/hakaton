Most of these languish in relative obscurity. But a few go viral: they explode across the web, attracting the attention of hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of people in short order. <a id=\"2a_start\" name=\"2a_start\"></a>Content that goes viral may remain in the public consciousness for days, weeks, or longer.<a id=\"2a_end\" name=\"2a_end\"></a> <a id=\"2b_start\" name=\"2b_start\"></a>So for those who want to reach a large audience&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s for a corporate marketing campaign or to promote a personal cause or to show the world your cat&rsquo;s amazing yodeling ability&mdash;the question of what makes content go viral online is important.<a id=\"2b_end\" name=\"2b_end\"></a><p><a id=\"3s_start\" name=\"3s_start\"></a>In our research, two of us (Milkman and Berger) have explored what it is that makes some content spread like wildfire and whether it&rsquo;s possible to deliberately achieve viral status.

Although the second paragraph raises the question of &ldquo;whether it&rsquo;s possible to deliberately achieve viral status,&rdquo; the idea that some people hope their content will go viral is introduced in the first paragraph with the discussion of &ldquo;those who want to reach a large audience.&rdquo;</p>\n"},"c":{"body":"<p>acknowledge one aspect of viral content that the researchers still do not understand.</p>\n","rationale":"<p>Choice C is incorrect.
